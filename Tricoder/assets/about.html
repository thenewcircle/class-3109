<h1>About Tricoder</h1>

<p>Tricoder is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder">Star Trek</a> 
Tricoder:</p>

<p>In the fictional Star Trek universe, a tricorder is a multifunction hand-held 
device used for sensor scanning, data analysis, and recording data.
Three primary variants of the tricorder are issued in Star Trek's Starfleet. 
The standard tricorder is a general-purpose device used primarily to scout 
unfamiliar areas, make detailed examination of living things, and record and 
review technical data. The medical tricorder is used by doctors to help diagnose 
diseases and collect bodily information about a patient; the key difference 
between this and a standard tricorder is a detachable hand-held high-resolution 
scanner stored in a compartment of the tricorder when not in use.

The engineering tricorder is fine-tuned for starship engineering purposes. 
There are also many other lesser-used varieties of special-use tricorders. 
The word "tricorder" is a portmanteau of "tri-" and "recorder", referring 
to the device's three default scanning functions: GEO (geological), 
MET (meteorological), and BIO (biological).</p>
